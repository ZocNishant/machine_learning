Steps in machine learning:

1. Import the data
2. Clean the data
3. Split the data into training/test sets
4. Create a model
5. Train the model
6. Make predictions
7. Evaluate and improve

Libraries and Tools

NumPy - Multi Dimentional array
Pandas - data analysis that provide concept of data frame--its a 2d data structure similar to excel sheet rows and columns
matplotlib - 2d plot for grpahs
scikit-learn - provides algorithms
